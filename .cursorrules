This project is a data generator to produce realistic looking data for a fictitious
company that operatates ghost kitchens. In ghost kitchens, vendors can rent kitchen space
to prepare meals (menu items) for their brands. Meals are prepared exclusively for delivery.
The following is a <description> of the fictitious company.

We are building an agent based simulator for the operation of this company including
relevant interactions with the environment. The simulator is written in Rust and
manages much of its internal state using Apache Arrow, specifically the `arrow-rs`
project.

Some code is generated from protobuf files located in the `./protos` folder.

The main simulator code is located in the `./crates/universe` folder.
The code is organized in the following modules.
- `models` contains mostly generated data objects.
- `state` contains abstractions for higer level Datasets that are tracked and updated by teh simulation.
- `agents` contains implementations for agents in the simulation.
- `simulation` module to drive the simulation and collect stats / snapshots.

## Coding Standards
- Never alter generated code in the `./crates/universe/src/models/gen/` folder.
- Additional `impl`s for the generated code should be in `./crates/universe/src/models/`
