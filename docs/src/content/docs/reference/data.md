* expose routing graph data via delta sharing
* time zone data from: https://timezonedb.com/download

## People, Places, & Things

To run a simulation a minimum set o tables containing at least some data is required.

### Shared data

Some data can be shared across simulation instances. This includes:

* routing / navigation data used or planning movements of people
* time zone data used to time zone adjustments based on location
* Simulation/snapshot metadata

### Simulation data

Some data is specific to a simulation instance, but needs to be defined prior to running the simulation.
While this data can be updatted during the course of a simulation, the changes are always triggered via
an control plant operation and may require re-initializing a simulation to update its internal state.
This data includes:

* Sites, kitchens, and kitchen stations
* Vendors, brands, and menu items
* Population

## Simulation state

The simulation state comprises data representing the current state of the simulated world.
This may include new objects [generated in the simulation](#internal-entities) (e.g. orders, deliveries, etc.)
or [additional state](#internal-state) information for externally defined entities (e.g. current people locations, etc.)

### Internal entities

* Orders and order lines

### Internal state

* People locations and activities
